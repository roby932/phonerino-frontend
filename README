React starter kit.

Packed full of goodies such as: 
 - React (duh!)
 - Redux with react-redux, redux-actions, redux-thunk.
 - Boostrap and font-awesome with sass
 - Custom router based on hash-routing
 - Superagent with bluebird promises for Ajax
 - Ramda as a functional utility library (don't let me catch any of you using lodash or underscore)

USAGE:
  1 clone this repo
  2 run npm install
  3 run npm start
  4 navigate to http://localhost:8080
  5 experience extreme joy

Other commands:
  - npm prod-build : generate production build
  - npm deploy : custom deploy task; uses rsync to push files on server; make sure to config ssh and change the task from package.json to suit your needs.


Notes, guidelines, tips and trics:
  - Use functional programming concepts as much as possible(https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
    - prefer use of stateless functions as React components: https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components
    - use pure functions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function
    - favor composition over inheritance: http://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose 
    - prefer free point programming style: https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/ch5.html#pointfree
